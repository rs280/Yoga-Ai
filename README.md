# Yoga-Ai
## Inspiration
Peopleâ€™s mental and physical health is deteriorating. Taking care of your mental and physical health is more important than ever during this pandemic. There is no better way to take care of your mental and physical health than yoga. Yoga can be done at home without any equipment with our virtual trainer.

## What it does
This is a virtual yoga trainer. It monitors your posture using Tensorflow during various yoga poses, and tells if you are doing it correctly. It also counts the number of repetitions and says it out loud.

## How we built it
We are using Posenet to validate proper posture. 
## Challenges we ran into
Creating a PoseNet Model
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Created a working trainer for 8 yoga poses
## What we learned
Tensorflow, Posenet
## What's next for Yoga AI
Add more poses
Make it a fitbit app to add meditation
Make it more user friendly by adding music, and accounts where you can earn badges for doing yoga
Make it a game where you compete against others to perform the pose the best
